## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains **three data analytics and machine learning projects** created as part of a learning and internship journey.

The projects focus on:
- understanding data,
- extracting insights,
- building machine learning models,
- and deploying models as applications.

Each project is kept **simple, logical, and easy to understand**.

## 📊 Project 1: Exploratory Sales Data Analysis (EDA)

📈 **Objective**  
To understand sales data by identifying trends, seasonality, and promotion impact.

### 🔧 What was done
- Loaded and cleaned sales dataset  
- Handled missing values  
- Converted date column for time analysis  
- Visualized sales trends and monthly patterns  
- Analyzed promotion impact  

### ✅ Key Outcome
- Clear understanding of sales behavior  
- Strong foundation for machine learning
