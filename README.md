## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains **three end-to-end data analytics and machine learning projects** designed and built following **real-world industry workflows**.

The focus is not just on writing code, but on:
- understanding data deeply,
- extracting business insights,
- building reliable machine learning models,
- and deploying them as usable applications.

Each project builds on the previous one, forming a **complete analytics pipeline**.

</p>

### 🔍 Objective
To explore and analyze historical sales data in order to understand:
- overall sales trends,
- seasonal patterns,
- promotion impact,
- and key business drivers.

This project focuses on **data understanding**, which is the foundation of all analytics and machine learning work.

### 🛠 Work Done
- Loaded and cleaned large-scale sales data
- Handled missing values using business logic
- Converted date columns for time-series analysis
- Analyzed:
  - daily and monthly sales trends
  - seasonality using resampling
  - promotion vs non-promotion sales
  - top-performing stores and product families
- Applied rolling averages to smooth noise and reveal long-term trends

### 📈 Key Insights
- Sales show strong time-based trends and seasonality
- Promotional activities positively affect average sales
- A small subset of stores and product categories contribute most of the revenue
- Proper data cleaning is essential before modeling

### 💡 Skills Demonstrated
`Data Cleaning` • `EDA` • `Visualization` • `Business Insight Extraction`

</p>

### 🔍 Objective
To predict sales using regression models by explicitly capturing **trend and seasonality** from time-based features.

This project transitions from analytics to **machine learning thinking**.

### 🛠 Work Done
- Engineered time-based features:
  - year, month, day, weekday
- Performed **time-aware train–test split** to avoid data leakage
- Built and compared:
  - Linear Regression (baseline)
  - Polynomial Regression (non-linear trends)
- Evaluated models using MAE and RMSE
- Visualized actual vs predicted sales for performance comparison

### 📈 Key Insights
- Polynomial regression captured seasonal and non-linear patterns better
- Feature engineering significantly improved model performance
- Correct validation strategy is critical in time-series forecasting

### 💡 Skills Demonstrated
`Feature Engineering` • `Regression Modeling` • `Time-Series Forecasting` • `Model Evaluation`

</p>

### 🔍 Objective
To deploy a trained machine learning model as a **web application** that allows users to predict sales in real time.

This project demonstrates **end-to-end ML deployment**, from training to production.

### 🛠 Work Done
- Trained a regression-based ML model on historical sales data
- Saved the trained model and preprocessing pipeline
- Built an interactive **Streamlit web application**
- Designed user input for future dates and promotion values
- Generated instant sales predictions through the deployed model

### 🔄 Application Workflow
User Input → Feature Transformation → ML Model → Sales Prediction


### 🚀 Outcome
- Converted analytical work into a usable product
- Demonstrated full ML lifecycle: training → saving → deployment
- Enabled business-style decision support using ML

### 💡 Skills Demonstrated
`Model Deployment` • `Streamlit` • `ML Pipelines` • `End-to-End Systems`
